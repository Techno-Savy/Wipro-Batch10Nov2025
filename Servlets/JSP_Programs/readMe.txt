JSP :-- JavaServer Pages is also a server side technology which allows to create dynamic , platform independent
web pages using java 

HTML is on client side and JSP is on server side  why we prefer jsp because it 
combines HTML with Java Code that executes on the server to generate dynamic content for users.

After processing the request of a client, 
 then server will combine the response of java (business logic) and Html(UI) and return to the client
